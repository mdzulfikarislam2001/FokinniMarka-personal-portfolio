            <p>I am an Electrical Department student. I want to be a developer. So I enrolled in Programming Hero.
                So I can take the lessons learned from them and become a junior web developer. And now I can do
                pretty much anything. Everyone will pray for me so that I can finish the journey of programming hero
                in a beautiful way.</p>

                    how to make simple website. My goal is to build websites and learn advanced topics.</p>

            <p>I am learning HTML, CSS. I know a little work to make a website poster. I did not stop with the web. I
                also learned a thing called git. So I think one day I will be able to go a long way and build a much
                bigger website.
